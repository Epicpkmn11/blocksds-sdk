argv test
#########

Running on hardware
===================

Most flashcarts and DSi loaders support the argv protocol defined in this
website: https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Homebrew_Menu

This test ROM prints the list of arguments that has been received from the
loader.

Running on emulators
====================

Out of all tested emulators, only DeSmuMe supports argv.

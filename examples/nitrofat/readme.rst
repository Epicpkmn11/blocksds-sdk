Running on hardware
===================

This ROM can be placed on a flashcart with DLDI support, or in the SD slot of
the DSi. It needs a loader that supports the argv protocol defined in this
website: https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Homebrew_Menu

Check the `argv example <../argv>`_ to check if your loader supports it.

Running on emulators
====================

Any emulator should be able to run this example.
